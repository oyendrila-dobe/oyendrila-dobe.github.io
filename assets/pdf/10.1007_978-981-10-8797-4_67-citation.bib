abstract="This chapter proposes a novel approach towards extraction of brain tumor images from T1-type magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan images. The algorithm includes segmentation of the scan image using a rough set-based K-means algorithm. It is followed by the use of global thresholding and morphological operations to extract an image of the tumor-affected region in the scan. This algorithm has been found to extract tumor images more accurately compared than existing algorithms.",
