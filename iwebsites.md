* **Helpful guide during PhD journey:**
  - [The PhD Grind](https://www.scholat.com/teamwork/teamworkdownloadscholar.html?id=4924&teamId=1158) gives an exellent journal on the journey. Though the author graduated in another decade, the outlines of the key points, I believe, are still relevant. There are after-discussion on this [here](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/743) and [here](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/154473-the-phd-grind-main-grinds-and-side-grinds/fulltext).
