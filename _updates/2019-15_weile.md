headline: Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. Wei Le
---

I spend the summer as a research assistant under [Dr. Wei Le](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/weile). I got interested in program analysis during her course. I explored Helium, found case studies, and tried testing them. Helium aims to create a minimum size executable C/C++ code to recreate a bug. I learnt about docker and other program analysis tools during this experience.
