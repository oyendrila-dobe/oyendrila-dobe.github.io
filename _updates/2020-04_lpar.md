Our paper describing the solution to the parameter synthesis of DTMCs got accepted in LPAR 2020. Here, given probabilistic hyperproperties that must hold for the system, we try to find range of missing transition values in DTMCs. I have worked on this with [Dr. Ábrahám] [Erika], [Dr. Bartocci] [Ezio], and my advisor, [Dr. Borzoo] [Borzoo].
