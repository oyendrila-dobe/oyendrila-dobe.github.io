I received admission to attend [workshop by Galois] [Galois summer school] to learn about incorporation of trustworthiness in Ml, AI, DS. The workshop had lectures on the challenges that come into when applying these technologies to safety critical, real-life case studies. We also got to do group projects on modified datasets to recognize bias or predict results.
