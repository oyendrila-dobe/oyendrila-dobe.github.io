Our paper describing the introduction of asynchronicity when specifying probabilistic hyperproperties got accepted in QEST 2023. We have utilised the advantages of smart sampling in statistical model checker PLASMA (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6976581) to find a scalable solution for probabilistic HyperLTL. I have worked on this with [Stefan Schupp] [Stefan], [Axel Legay] [Axel], [Ezio Bartocci] [Ezio], [Miroslav Pajic] [Miroslav], [Yu Yang] [Yu], and my advisor, [Borzoo Bonakdarpour] [Borzoo] on this project.
