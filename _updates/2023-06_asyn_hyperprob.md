headline: 'Our paper on asynchronous HyperPCTL got accepted in [QEST-23][QEST 2023]'

Our paper describing the introduction of asynchronicity when specifying probabilistic hyperproperties got accepted in QEST 2023. We extend HyperPCTL with stutter schedulers which allows us to specify how we want to check for stuttering when verifying the rest of our specification. I have worked on this with Lina Gerlach, [Dr. Ábrahám] [Erika], [Dr. Bartocci] [Ezio], and my advisor, [Dr. Borzoo] [Borzoo] on this project.
