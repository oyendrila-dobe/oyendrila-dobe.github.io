Spent 15 weeks as an applied scientist intern under Aaron Tomb in the Dafny Team (Dafny is really cool, check them out [here](https://dafny.org/), exploring and learning about program equivalence across different languages. It was an opportunity for me understand the internal encoding of program structures in an intermediate language, the challenges of comparison of these encoding on different languages, and leanr whole new languages on-the-go to deliver artifacts in this short time. It also helped me visulize hyperproperties in a practical setting.
