###### Abstract

This paper proposes a technique to categorize a brain MRI as normal, in the absence of a brain tumor or as abnormal in the presence of one. Proposed method is divided into two steps. First, a set of feature is generated for accurately differentiating between a normal and abnormal MR scan images. Then, these features are reduced using fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the scan images into two groups, namely, tumor-free and tumor affected. The proposed method aims to produce higher specificity and sensitivity than the previous methods.
